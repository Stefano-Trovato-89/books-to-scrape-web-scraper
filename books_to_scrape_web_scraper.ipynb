        "\n",
        "In this project, I develop a web scraping script to extract information about books listed on the competitor’s online bookstore **Books to Scrape**.  \n",
        "The goal is to build a structured dataset and export it to `books.csv`, in order to support market analysis activities for **BookSmart Solutions S.r.l.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "For each book on the website, the following information is collected:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Title** – book title  \n",
        "- **Rating** – star rating (CSS class → numeric value from 1 to 5)  \n",
        "- **Price** – book price converted to a numeric value  \n",
        "- **Availability** – stock status (e.g. *In stock* / *Out of stock*)\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting dataset (1000 rows × 4 columns) can be used by the marketing and sales teams for pricing analysis, competitive benchmarking, and identifying the most relevant titles.\n",

        "## Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "- The target website `https://books.toscrape.com/` is **static**, so **Requests + BeautifulSoup** are sufficient (no need for Selenium).  \n",
        "- For each page, the script parses the `article.product_pod` blocks and extracts the title, rating, price, and availability.  \n",
        "- The rating is converted from the CSS class (`One`, `Two`, …) to a numeric value (1–5).  \n",
        "- The price is cleaned (removal of currency symbol, handling of special characters) and converted to a `float`.  \n",
        "- Pagination is handled automatically by following the `li.next` link across all pages.  \n",
        "- Network errors are managed with retry logic using exponential backoff and **polite rate limiting** (random `sleep`).  \n",
        "- The final result is saved to `books.csv` and validated through a preview of the resulting DataFrame.\n"
